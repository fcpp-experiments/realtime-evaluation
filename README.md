# Experimental evaluation of real-time guarantees in FCPP

Experiments for the paper "" submitted to the _FoMaC Special Issue for ReoCAS 2024_ of the _International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer_ (STTT). 

The FCPP implementation of all examples presented in the paper is available in file [lib/examples.hpp](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-exercises/blob/master/lib/examples.hpp).
The executable simulation for the case study presented in the paper is available in file [run/examples.cpp](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-exercises/blob/master/run/examples.cpp).

All commands below are assumed to be issued from the cloned git repository folder. For any issues, please contact [Giorgio Audrito](mailto:giorgio.audrito@unito.it).

## Setup

The next sections contain the setup instructions for the various supported OSs. Jump to the section dedicated to your system of choice and ignore the others.

### Windows

Pre-requisites:
- [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org)
- [Asymptote](http://asymptote.sourceforge.io) (for building the plots)

At this point, run "MSYS2 MinGW x64" from the start menu; a terminal will appear. Run the following commands:
```
pacman -Syu
```
After updating packages, the terminal will close. Open it again, and then type:
```
pacman -Sy --noconfirm --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-make git
```
The build system should now be available from the "MSYS2 MinGW x64" terminal.

### Linux

Pre-requisites:
- Xorg-dev package (X11)
- G++ 9 (or higher)
- CMake 3.18 (or higher)
- Asymptote (for building the plots)

To install these packages in Ubuntu, type the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install xorg-dev g++ cmake asymptote
```
In Fedora, the `xorg-dev` package is not available. Instead, install the packages:
```
libX11-devel libXinerama-devel.x86_6 libXcursor-devel.x86_64 libXi-devel.x86_64 libXrandr-devel.x86_64 mesa-libGL-devel.x86_64
```
In Arch Linux, you can instead install the packages as follows:
```
sudo pacman -S xorg-server-devel gcc cmake
yay -S asymptote
```

### MacOS

Pre-requisites:
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- CMake 3.18 (or higher)
- Asymptote (for building the plots)

To install them, assuming you have the [brew](https://brew.sh) package manager, type the following commands:
```
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake asymptote
```

### Virtual Machines

If you use a VM with a graphical interface, refer to the section for the operating system installed on it.

**Warning:** the graphical simulations are based on OpenGL, and common Virtual Machine software (e.g., VirtualBox) has faulty support for OpenGL. If you rely on a virtual machine for graphical simulations, it might work provided that you select hardware virtualization (as opposed to software virtualization). However, it is recommended to use the native OS whenever possible.


## Execution

In order to execute the examples file, type the following command in a terminal:
```
./make.sh gui run -O examples
```
On newer Mac M1 computers, the `-O` argument may induce compilation errors: in that case, use the `-O3` argument instead.
Running the above command, you should see output about building the executables then the graphical simulation should pop up while the console will show the most recent `stdout` and `stderr` outputs of the application, together with resource usage statistics (both on RAM and CPU).  During the execution, log files will be generated in the `output/` repository sub-folder. If a batch of multiple simulations is launched (which is not the case for the `exercises` target), individual simulation results will be logged in the `output/raw/` subdirectory, with the overall resume in the `output/` directory.

### Graphical User Interface

Executing a graphical simulation will open a window displaying the simulation scenario, initially still: you can start running the simulation by pressing `P` (current simulated time is displayed in the bottom-left corner). While the simulation is running, network statistics will be periodically printed in the console. You can interact with the simulation through the following keys:

- `Esc` to end the simulation
- `P` to stop/resume
- `O`/`I` to speed-up/slow-down simulated time
- `L` to show/hide connection links between nodes
- `G` to show/hide the grid on the reference plane and node pins
- `M` enables/disables the marker for selecting nodes
- `left-click` on a selected node to open a window with node details
- `C` resets the camera to the starting position
- `Q`,`W`,`E`,`A`,`S`,`D` to move the simulation area along orthogonal axes
- `right-click`+`mouse drag` to rotate the camera
- `mouse scroll` for zooming in and out
- `left-shift` added to the camera commands above for precision control
- any other key will show/hide a legenda displaying this list

Hovering on a node will also display its UID in the top-left corner.
